I decided to move my script development to a (public) core Repo:

https://github.com/Naios/DeepshjirRepack

Updates of my script (exept 4.2 content) will only provided at my new core repo.

Why i don't push my Scripts public anymore...

I saw that a lot of private servers and repacks are using my scripts but without giving me credits.
Sometimes it happened that repacks/private servers are saying that the scripts are developed by their own.
And i hate it if people and private servers are using my scripts that haven't ever commit to a public emu without giving me credits.

I don't exspect that people are giving me credits on releasing just a normal akrcore
for examle, but if they use my "private scripts" i exspect to give me credits.

Currently I'am developing on scripts for my Repack.
I Coded 100% working scripts of: Omnotron Defense System/ Chimaeron/ Maloriak/ Conclave of Wind.
I will release them in my Repack as compiled (not as src).

Currently I'am looking for Database and Core Developers that want to Develop a amazing 4.06 Cataclysm Repack.

This Cataclysm Scripts are working with the most Cataclysm EMU´s
(Currently they are Developed with TrilliumEMU (4.2a Scripts) and ArkCore (4.06a Scripts))
The target DB is ArkDB > 2.2.0.

All Scripts/ Sql files were tested and are working.


Some of this Repo Scripts are only fixed by me, not coded!
If i forgot to mention you in the credit list don`t hesitate to contact me.

The Repo is open for every Dev.
But if you use a Script it would be nice if you commit your
own fixes of my Scripts to this Repo.
